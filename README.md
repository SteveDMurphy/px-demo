## P.x Demo 1

This is a quick demo to show how the addition of a table containing data
which violates a policy can be caught in real time.

The open pull request is validation of those checks performing correctly,
catching something small that may otherwise go unnoticed. This provides an
engineer with the opportunity to remove/obfuscate the data, or alternatively
work with the privacy team to update the policy.
